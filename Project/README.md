# SageMaker Deployment Project
The Project is a notebook and collection of Python files to be completed. The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker. Completing the XGBoost Sentiment Analysis notebook should suffice.
**Additional Files**: Lamba functions, API gateways.
Screenshots are attached in the Project folder.

**RNN algorithm**: LSTM
**Notebook instance**: Sagemaker


### Test Results ###
